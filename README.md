# switched-reluctance-motor-configurator

Explore various combinations of coils and poles of switched reluctance motors

# Goals

Initially it was really hard to wrap my head around different combinations of coil and
pole count in switched reluctance motor so I made a browser tool to help me visualize
how coils and poles interracts, and to help me find out what kind of motor I need.
This is mostly for PCB based motors. You can change outer diameter of the motor,
coil diameter, number of coils and poles.

# Results

[Here](https://dvhx.github.io/switched-reluctance-motor-configurator/index.html) is tool where
you can visualize one motor, choose parameters and click on the Step button to move
the motor forward. 

[Here](https://dvhx.github.io/switched-reluctance-motor-configurator/configurations.html) are
all possible combinations in one big table. For combination of up to 12 coils and poles, there
are **144** combinations, out of which only 92 produce valid motors.

You can use this table to choose how many steps, coils and poles suits your needs the best.
